Retrieval Augmented Generation using openai, streamlit, langchain and Pinecone
Project aims to solve some common problems faced by early stage coders [python].
we intend to solve following problems for coders:
1- Understanding if the git repo they think , is going to help them solve the problem , really going to solve their problem.
2- Explain math behind the code.
3- what are common issues faced by other people in running the same code.[ users would be able to directly find answers from our interface]
4- git branches sometimes are more relevant to your problem than main branch, but coders spend lot of time in figuring this out.
5- dependency issues lead to lot of errors, for eg you might make a conda environment with wrong python version and many functionalities of code dont work.
